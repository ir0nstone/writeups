# Substitution0

So, we are told that the key is at the beginning! Let's see what we have:

```
ZGSOCXPQUYHMILERVTBWNAFJDK 

Qctcnrel Mcptzlo ztebc, fuwq z ptzac zlo bwzwcmd zut, zlo gtenpqw ic wqc gccwmc
xtei z pmzbb szbc ul fqusq uw fzb clsmebco. Uw fzb z gcznwuxnm bsztzgzcnb, zlo, zw

Wqc xmzp ub: ruseSWX{5NG5717N710L_3A0MN710L_357GX9XX}
```

So, the first line appears to be the "key". Well, if we write the alphabet under it:

```
ZGSOCXPQUYHMILERVTBWNAFJDK
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

There is a perfect correspondence! So, any instance of the character in the top list is meant to be substituted using the bottom list. We can easily make a python program to do it for us:

```python
from string import ascii_uppercase, ascii_lowercase

alphabet = 'ZGSOCXPQUYHMILERVTBWNAFJDK'

text = '''

Wqc xmzp ub: ruseSWX{5NG5717N710L_3A0MN710L_357GX9XX}
'''

dec = ''

for c in text:
    if c in ascii_uppercase:
        dec += ascii_uppercase[alphabet.index(c)]
    elif c in ascii_lowercase:
        dec += ascii_lowercase[alphabet.index(c.upper())]
    else:
        dec += c

print(dec)

# picoCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_357BF9FF}

```

We get a text from [_The Gold-Bug_, by Edgar Allen Poe](http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/minstrel/mifieapat.html) and the flag too:

```
Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle
from a glass case in which it was enclosed. It was a beautiful scarabaeus, and, at
that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a scientific point
of view. There were two round black spots near one extremity of the back, and a
long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the
appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and,
taking all things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion
respecting it.

The flag is: picoCTF{5UB5717U710N_3V0LU710N_357BF9FF}
```
