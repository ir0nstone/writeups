# morse-code

Pretty explicitly morse code, we go to an [online decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) and have it spit out the flag:

```
picoCTF{WH47_H47H_90D_W20U9H7}
```

Alternatively we could use something like **Audacity** to view the waveforms themselves, but nah.
