# rail-fence

So, you can use an online tool like [here](https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher), or you can actually follow [the wikipedia page it gives you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail\_fence\_cipher), or you can play around until it works:

```
T     a     -     _     7     N     6     D     4     9
 h   l g   : W   3 D   _ H   3 C   3 1   N _   _ A   9 7
  e f   - s   H R   0 5   3 F   3 8   N 4   3 D   7 B
   -     i     3     3     _     _     _     N     6

The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_4A76B997
```

So the flag is `picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_4A76B997}`
